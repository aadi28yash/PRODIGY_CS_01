The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it in his private correspondence, the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
Encryption:
To encrypt a message, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
A becomes D
B becomes E
C becomes F
..., and so on.
The alphabet wraps around so that after Z comes A again. For example, with a shift of 3:
X becomes A
Y becomes B
Z becomes C
Decryption:
Decrypting a message involves shifting the letters in the ciphertext back by the same fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of 3:
D becomes A
E becomes B
F becomes C
..., and so on.
Shift Value:
The shift value (also called the key) is a number that determines how many places each letter is shifted. It can be any integer, but typically it's in the range of 0-25 for the English alphabet.# PRODIGY_CS_01
